# Curated-C Template

The purpose of this repository is to serve as a template for new Lingua Franca (LF)
projects that use the C target. The goal is to provide a large number of examples
and documentation specific to the C target so as to guide AI assistants that are
using RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation).

To use this, at the [curated-c homepage](https://github.com/lf-lang/curated-c),
select "Use this template" to create a new repository.

This repository contains the following:

* A `context` directory with many examples of Lingua Franca (LF) programs for the C target.

* A `scripts` directory with utilities used to update the context.

* A `Makefile` for formatting LF files, cleaning build artifacts, and updating the context.

* A `src` directory with an [example LF program](src/README.md) to help users get started.
